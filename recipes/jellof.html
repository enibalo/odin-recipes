        <h4 >Description</h4>
        <p>Jollof is a delicious nigerian dish commonly eaten at parties and at weddings. Jollof is a little challenging to make
            without burning some rice so don't feel bad if you do. I hope one person looking at this website gets so good at making jellof that
            they can make it based on muscle-memory. Or should we say <em>ktichen-memory</em>... Even if you aren't great at cooking 
            I feel that this is a recipe that you can give a <strong>shot!</strong> I love jellof and I hope you will love it too after trying to make it yourself. 
        </p>
        <p>Jollof is essentially rice that absorbs a blended pepper mix, instead of spiced water like most recipes you may have tried before. So, you may notice 
            that getting the temperature and cooking-time tight might take you a few tries. As I said previously, you will probaly not escape without a burnt layer at the bottom
            on your first try so be <strong>WARNED!</strong>
        </p>
